# Emergency 911 - Calls

This is an open-source dataset project about emergency 911 calls made in Montgomery County, PA, from 2015 to 2020. The project aims to analyze the frequency, reasons, and patterns of 911 calls and provide insights that can inform emergency response planning, resource allocation, and public safety initiatives.

## Features

- [x] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- [x] Data Visualization
- [x] Insights on emergency call patterns

## Key Findings and Insights

### Most Common Call Categories

- The majority of 911 calls were related to Emergency Medical Services (EMS), followed by Traffic and Fire-related calls.
- The top reasons for EMS-related calls were fall victims, respiratory emergencies, and cardiac emergencies.
- The most common reasons for Fire-related calls were fire alarms, vehicle accidents, and fire investigations.
- The most common reasons for Traffic-related calls were vehicle accidents, disabled vehicles, and road obstructions.

### High Call Volume Days

- The analysis revealed a significant spike in the number of calls on specific days, such as March 2, 2018, which had over 2100 calls.
- Further analysis could explore the reasons behind these spikes and how they relate to specific emergencies or events.

### Trend Analysis

- The analysis also showed a decline in 911 calls in 2020, which was attributed to incomplete data from August to December.
- The data from 2015 was also incomplete, with only data for December available.
- Additional data collection and analysis could provide insights into the specific causes of the decline in 2020.

### Recommendations for Future Analysis

- Further analysis could explore the reasons behind the prominence of vehicle accidents across all three categories (EMS, Fire, and Traffic).
- Seasonal variations and their impact on emergency calls could be studied in greater detail.
- Additional data collection and analysis could provide insights into the specific causes of the decline in 2020.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the nature and patterns of 911 calls in Montgomery County, PA, from 2015 to 2020. Further research and analysis could deepen our understanding of these trends and help improve emergency services and response strategies.
